# Assignment Repository(DevTown) - Kavya

This repository contains my GitHub-based assignment as per the given instructions. It demonstrates my understanding of version control, branching, pull requests, and basic CI/CD using GitHub Actions.

## Files

- `assignment.txt`: A sample assignment file with basic content.
- `.github/workflows/main.yml`: A GitHub Actions workflow that runs a simple CI job.

## Branches Created

- `main` (default branch)
- `feature1`
- `feature2`
- `feature3`

Each feature branch was merged into `main` using a pull request.

## GitHub Actions

A basic CI pipeline has been implemented that runs on every `push` to the repository. It prints:
Hello from Github Actions!
